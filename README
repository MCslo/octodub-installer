To get octodub-installer working as it should, you should have a Portable Python instalation in its folder. 
Also needed is a folder named "installers", in this folder we put the .exe and .msi installer files of aplications.
This is the developement version of octodub, so you need to manualy do these things and add the installers in the directory.
You also need to specify every installer that isnt in the install_config.xml.
I will try my best to add as many configurations in there, but there will always be some, that i didnt think of.

I plan to make a install package in the future, so you dont have to do those things manualy.
Also, a auto downloader of installers in planned, so you can predownload the stuff (if you find yourself on a offline computer).

FAQ
Why have octodub installer if you have things like ninte and others? 

Because most of the autoinstallers get their files from the internet and dont work if you are offline. 
And also, because I need to get into a project and this came up first from the things that i find anoying when i need to reinstall peoples PC-s :D
